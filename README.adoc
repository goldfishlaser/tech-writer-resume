= Melanie Allen Resume

I generated this resume using an https://github.com/capsulecorplab/tech-writer-resume[Open-Source template] that uses a https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[docs-as-code] approach.

Resume is generated as both an html & pdf document,
using https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]
 - a static-site generator for the
https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[AsciiDoc] markup language,
then published to https://goldfishlaser.github.io/tech-writer-resume/,
using https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages[GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages].
